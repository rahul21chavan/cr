## 1. AWS Core Services ‚Äì Basics

### What is AWS? What are the benefits of using AWS?
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a cloud platform with 200+ services (compute, storage, database, etc.).
- **Benefits:** Pay-as-you-go, scalable, secure, global, no need to manage hardware.

---

### Difference between EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda?
- **EC2:** Virtual servers (‚ÄúVMs‚Äù) to run any software.
- **S3:** Object storage for files/data (images, logs, backups, etc.).
- **RDS:** Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Lambda:** Run code without servers (‚Äúserverless‚Äù) triggered by events.

---

### Explain regions and availability zones in AWS.
- **Region:** A separate geographic location (e.g., us-east-1).
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** One or more datacenters in a region. Used for redundancy.

---

### What is IAM? How do you manage roles and permissions?
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Controls who can do what in AWS.
- **Roles:** Used for apps/services, not users.
- **Permissions:** Set using policies (allow/deny actions on resources).

---

### What is the shared responsibility model in AWS?
- **AWS:** Manages the cloud (hardware, infra, security of cloud).
- **You:** Manage your data, apps, user permissions (security in the cloud).

---

## 2. AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) üî•

- **S3:** Scalable object storage for files.
- **Use cases:** Backups, static website hosting, log/data storage, ML data lakes.

---

### How do you store and retrieve files from S3 using Boto3 or PySpark?
**Boto3 (Python):**
```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
# Upload
s3.upload_file('local.txt', 'my-bucket', 'folder/file.txt')
# Download
s3.download_file('my-bucket', 'folder/file.txt', 'local.txt')
```
**PySpark:**
```python
df = spark.read.csv('s3a://my-bucket/data.csv')
df.write.parquet('s3a://my-bucket/out/')
```

---

### Difference between S3 Standard, IA, and Glacier?
- **Standard:** Frequent access, fast, more expensive.
- **IA (Infrequent Access):** Cheaper, for less-used data.
- **Glacier:** Archival, super cheap, slow retrieval.

---

### What are pre-signed URLs? How are they used?
- **Pre-signed URL:** Temporary link to upload/download S3 file without making bucket public.
```python
url = s3.generate_presigned_url('get_object', Params={'Bucket': 'my-bucket', 'Key': 'file.txt'}, ExpiresIn=600)
```

---

### What are S3 events and how can they trigger Lambda?
- S3 can send events (e.g., new file uploaded) to trigger a Lambda function for processing.

---

## 3. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Difference between IAM user, group, role, and policy?
- **User:** Individual identity (person/app).
- **Group:** Collection of users (assign same permissions).
- **Role:** Temporary permissions for AWS resources (used by apps/services).
- **Policy:** Document defining permissions (what actions allowed/denied).

---

### How do you give read-only access to a user for a specific S3 bucket?
- Attach a policy to the user:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
```

---

### What is the principle of least privilege?
