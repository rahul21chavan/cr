# SAS to PySpark Migration Guide

## üìå Introduction

For decades, sectors such as Banking & Finance (BFSI), Pharma, Healthcare, Retail, and Telecom have relied heavily on **SAS (Statistical Analysis System)** to perform critical business functions:
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Moving and transforming data between systems.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Building models for forecasting, risk, churn, and more.
- **Analytics:** Generating business insights from data.
- **Reporting:** Automated dashboarding, regulatory compliance, and performance tracking.

But the landscape is changing rapidly. The rise of **big data**, cloud architectures, and open-source technologies‚Äîespecially **PySpark**‚Äîis driving the migration of SAS workloads to modern platforms.

## üìù Understanding SAS Scripts

A SAS script (commonly with a `.sas` extension) is a sequence of commands, steps, and logic blocks written in the SAS programming language. These typically include:

1. **DATA Steps:**  
   - Used for data preparation, cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.
   - Example: Calculating new columns, filtering rows.

2. **PROC Steps:**  
   - Procedures for analytics: statistics, regressions, report generation, charting.

3. **PROC SQL:**  
   - SQL queries (joins, aggregations, filtering) run inside SAS.

4. **Macros:**  
   - Parameterized code blocks and automation tools for reusability and modularity.

5. **LIBNAME / FILENAME Statements:**  
   - External data connections‚Äîlocal files, databases, remote servers.

6. **ODS Statements (Output Delivery System):**  
   - Exporting results to PDF, Excel, HTML, etc.

7. **Documentation & Comments:**  
   - Proper annotation for maintainability.

```sas
LIBNAME saleslib "C:\Data\Sales";

DATA work.cleaned_sales;
    SET saleslib.raw_sales;
    profit = revenue - cost;
RUN;

PROC SQL;
    SELECT region, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
    FROM work.cleaned_sales
    GROUP BY region;
QUIT;
```

## ‚ùì Why Migrate from SAS to PySpark?

Migration is a strategic imperative for many organizations, driven by several key factors:

### 1. **High Licensing Costs üí∞**
- **SAS:** Expensive, per-user or per-server licensing.
- **PySpark:** Free and open-source; no licensing fees.

### 2. **Scalability üöÄ**
- **SAS:** Traditionally limited to single machines or proprietary grid solutions.
- **PySpark:** Built for distributed computing across clusters and cloud platforms.

### 3. **Cloud & Modern Data Stack üåê**
- PySpark natively integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks, Snowflake, etc.
- SAS has limited support for modern cloud platforms.

### 4. **Flexibility üì¶**
- **SAS:** Proprietary, closed ecosystem.
- **PySpark:** Part of the Python ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.).

### 5. **Talent Availability üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª**
- SAS programmers are rare and expensive.
- Python/PySpark talent is abundant and growing.

### 6. **Innovation & Future-Proofing ‚ö°**
- Open-source tools evolve rapidly, supporting cutting-edge AI/ML.
- Reduces vendor lock-in and fosters innovation.

## üìä What Data is Migrated?

A typical SAS-to-PySpark migration encompasses:

### 1. **Structured Business Data**
- Transactions, sales, customer profiles, insurance claims, clinical trials, telecom billing, etc.

### 2. **ETL & Data Warehousing Loads**
- Flat files (CSV, TXT, XLS), SAS datasets (`.sas7bdat`), staging tables.

### 3. **Analytical / Statistical Data**
- Model training datasets, summary tables, regression/forecast inputs.

### 4. **Historical Archives**
- Legacy SAS datasets (often >10 years old) moved to Parquet/Delta for cost-effective storage.

### 5. **Operational / Reporting Data**
- Daily/weekly/monthly reports, dashboards, fraud detection outputs.

### 6. **Semi-Structured Data**
- JSON logs, IoT sensor data, web clickstreams (handled more efficiently in PySpark).

## üîÑ Migration Workflow (High-Level)

Migration is a multi-step process involving:

### 1. **Assessment & Inventory**
- Catalog all SAS jobs, scripts, datasets, macros, and reports.
- Classify components: ETL, analytics, reporting, ML.

### 2. **Code Conversion**
- **DATA Steps ‚Üí PySpark DataFrames.**
- **PROC SQL ‚Üí Spark SQL.**
- **Macros ‚Üí Python functions or parameterized notebooks.**

### 3. **Data Migration**
- Convert `.sas7bdat` files to Parquet/CSV and ingest into Spark.
- Validate schema and data integrity.

### 4. **Validation**
- Compare outputs from SAS and PySpark (row counts, summaries, aggregates).
- Ensure business logic and results match.

### 5. **Deployment**
- Run PySpark jobs on platforms like Databricks, AWS EMR, Azure Synapse, etc.
- Schedule workflows using Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or similar orchestration tools.

## ‚úÖ SAS vs PySpark: Example

**SAS Code:**
```sas
DATA work.profit;
    SET saleslib.sales;
    profit = revenue - cost;
RUN;

PROC SQL;
    SELECT region, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
    FROM work.profit
    GROUP BY region;
QUIT;
```

**PySpark Equivalent:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum as spark_sum

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SAS_Migration").getOrCreate()

# Read dataset
df = spark.read.csv("s3://bucket/sales.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Transformation
df_profit = df.withColumn("profit", col("revenue") - col("cost"))

# Aggregation
region_summary = df_profit.groupBy("region") \
                          .agg(spark_sum("profit").alias("total_profit"))

region_summary.show()
```
