## 2. Project/Experience Deep Dive

### Q3. SAS → PySpark Migration with Multi-Agent AI — Architecture
**Sample Answer:**
> Built a multi-agent orchestration framework: agents for parsing SAS, chunking code, translating logic to PySpark via GenAI (LangChain + OpenAI/Vertex AI), and validating outputs. Automated testing and accuracy checks were built-in, with all steps logged for traceability. CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform) ensured seamless deployments on AWS/Azure.

### Q4. Business Value Pitch for Client CFO
**Sample Answer:**
> Licensing costs down 50%+ post-SAS deprecation; infrastructure savings of ~₹30 lakh/year. Manual engineering cut by 60%, developer productivity tripled. Cloud migration enabled scalable analytics, freeing resources for new initiatives. “Our migration delivered 100% first-year ROI, halved costs, and future-proofed our talent pipeline.”

### Q5. GenAI Project — Handling Hallucination, Security, Evaluation
**Sample Answer:**
> Used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM outputs. Security via access controls, encryption, redaction, and private endpoints. Evaluation with automated metrics (faithfulness, groundedness) and SME review; all outputs audited before deployment.

## 3. Case/Scenario Round

### Q6. GenAI Compliance Assistant for Bank — Solution Overview
**Sample Answer:**
> Architecture: Deploy within VPC/on-prem, strict IAM, audit logging. Multi-agent RAG pipeline for compliance docs. Model: Open-source (LLaMA-3) or enterprise SaaS (OpenAI via Azure Confidential) based on data residency. Data privacy: Tokenization, PII masking, RBAC, private endpoints. KPIs: Compliance accuracy, manual reporting reduction, response latency, hallucination rate, audit pass. CFO pitch: “Automated, accurate compliance with 70% less manual effort; risk mitigation and direct cost savings.”

### Q7. Handling Client Objections on Hallucination/Risk
**Sample Answer:**
> RAG ensures answers are always source-backed. Layered review: Human compliance officers audit key outputs. Pilot phase and phased rollout demonstrate transparency, error handling, and safety.

## 4. High-Level Technical Questions

### Q8. RAG Architecture, Chunking, Retrievers, Hallucinations
**Sample Answer:**
> RAG combines LLMs with document retrieval; answers are based on relevant, indexed chunks (split by semantic units, 256–800 tokens). Retrievers: BM25 for keyword docs, embeddings for semantic, hybrid for best results. Hallucinations reduced by grounding prompt context and tuning retriever parameters.

### Q9. RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs LoRA/PEFT — When to Use?
| Method      | Use For         | Why                                  |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| RAG         | Dynamic, up-to-date knowledge | Avoids data leakage, stays current |
| Fine-tuning | Deep, stable expertise        | Customizes model, static needs     |
| LoRA/PEFT   | Quick domain adaptation, low resource | Lightweight, fast, less compute   |

### Q10. Evaluating GenAI App: Metrics
**Sample Answer:**
> Track relevance, faithfulness, groundedness with test sets. Human SME reviews, scenario-based validation, end-user surveys. Use both for holistic evaluation and continuous improvement.

### Q11. Client: “Why not use GPT-4 directly?”
**Sample Answer:**
> GPT-4 lacks grounding, compliance, and control; data privacy risks and no regulatory traceability. Deloitte’s solution enables tailored architecture, risk management, and business alignment—beyond just API utility.

## 5. Behavioral / Consulting Fit

### Q12. Conflicting Stakeholder Requirements — Resolution
**Sample Answer:**
> Situation: Cloud migration with conflicting requests. Task: Map priorities, joint sessions for consensus. Action: Focused on shared goals, weighted scoring, transparent tracking. Result: Unified platform, high approval, repeat requests.

### Q13. Tight Deadline / Limited Resources — Prioritization
**Sample Answer:**
> Situation: 2-week ETL delivery, small team. Task: Build MVP with critical features. Action: Modular breakdown, automated testing/deployment, clear ownership. Result: On-time delivery, client POC extension.

### Q14. Unknown Answer to Exec — Response
**Sample Answer:**
> Admit gap, explain commitment to quality. Document, research, return with clear answer. Result: Built trust through transparency.

### Q15. Cross-Team Collaboration — Example
**Sample Answer:**
> Situation: Multi-agent GenAI migration, multiple teams. Task: Orchestrate unified delivery. Action: Cross-team stand-ups, documentation, sync points. Result: Faster delivery, template for future projects.
